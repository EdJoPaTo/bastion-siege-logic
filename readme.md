# Bastion Siege Logic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EdJoPaTo/bastion-siege-logic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EdJoPaTo/bastion-siege-logic)

This project contains what I reverse engineered about the logic of [BastionSiege](https://telegram.me/BastionSiegeBot?start=ab4b7ba6256a86b6), a Telegram Game made by [@DorianPeregrim](https://t.me/DorianPeregrim).

I like the game and like the challenge of reverse engineering it for fun and improving my programming skills.

This library can be used for assisting purposes like [@BastionSiegeAssistBot](https://t.me/BastionSiegeAssistBot) ([EdJoPaTo/BastionSiegeAssistBot](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/BastionSiegeAssistBot)) but is not intended for game automation or other means of cheating within the game.
Please respect the fun of others and Dorians work creating the game.


## API

The TypeScript types and method names should help you enough :)
