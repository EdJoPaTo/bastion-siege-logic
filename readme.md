# Bastion Siege Logic

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bastion-siege-logic.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bastion-siege-logic)

This project contains what I reverse engineered about the logic of [BastionSiege](https://telegram.me/BastionSiegeBot?start=ab4b7ba6256a86b6), a Telegram Game made by [@DorianPeregrim](https://t.me/DorianPeregrim).

Bastion Siege 1 isnt running anymore and this project was made for BS1 specifically.

I liked the game and like the challenge of reverse engineering it for fun and improving my programming skills.

This library was used for assisting purposes like the [EdJoPaTo/BastionSiegeAssistBot](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/BastionSiegeAssistBot) and was never intended for game automation or other means of cheating within the game.
Please respect the fun of others and Dorians work creating the game.
